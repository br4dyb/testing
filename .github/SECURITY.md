## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our projects and users very seriously.  
If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in reporting it responsibly.

> [!CAUTION]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities!**

Instead, please report it through one of the following methods:

### 1. Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

Use the **GitHub private vulnerability reporting feature** to submit your report privately.  
You can access this by going to the **"Security"** tab of the affected repository and clicking **"Report a vulnerability"**.

This is the most secure and recommended way to report vulnerabilities!

---

### 2. Backup Method: Email

If the GitHub Security Advisories feature is not *available or disabled*, please send an email to:

üìß [halting.credo.00@icloud.com](mailto:halting.credo.00@icloud.com)

*Please only use this method as a backup, and preferably via encrypted email accounts.*
