## ✍️ How to Contribute

We accept contributions in the form of:

- 🔧 Bug fixes
- 🚀 New features (discussed first!)
- 🧹 Refactoring or code cleanup
- 📝 Documentation improvements

---

## 🧱 Our Development Workflow

All changes must go through a pull request:

1. **Create an Issue** (for bug reports or actionable features).
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main` (never commit directly to `main`).
3. **Open a Pull Request** linked to the relavant Issue(s).
4. **Request a review** and wait for approval before merging.

🔒 Branch protection rules are enabled to ensure code review and test safety.

## 🚨 Issues Are for Actionable Items Only

Please only open **GitHub Issues** for:

- ✅ Verified bugs
- 📦 Work-in-progress features that have been discussed
- 🔨 Technical tasks or codebase improvements

If your idea or problem doesn’t fit these, head to Discussions instead!

## 💬 Use Discussions for Everything Else!

Use the **Discussions tab** for:

- 🤔 General questions or product support
- 💡 Feature ideas or suggestions
- 🧠 Brainstorming or feedback
- 📢 Sharing how you use the project

This keeps the Issues tracker focused and actionable.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open an issue**.
